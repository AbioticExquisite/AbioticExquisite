## 🌷 Hiya !
"Hi there this is my markdown file" - Mr. Forlenza, 2026

-----------

💼 I am a student living in Brooklyn with an interest of becoming either a filmmaker x game designer, or a business owner. My hobbies consist of dancing, singing, music, playing my Uke, volleyball, reading, writing, typing, and a lot more.

🎯 Fun fact ! : I'm possibly the youngest in the room of those born in 2009.

🗒️ There's definitely more that I can say, however, that's up to you to find out >:)
